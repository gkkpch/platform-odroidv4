# Build the Odroid N2 and C4 Linux Kernel

This repository provides the tooling necessary for building the Odroid N2 and C4 platform components — including the Linux kernel, firmware packages, configuration files, and support scripts. It does **not** produce a complete system image.

The system was originally developed by Gé Koerkamp in 2026. It reflects significant engineering work aimed at providing a stable, modular, and forward-compatible kernel environment for Volumio’s Odroid platforms.

As of **Feb 2026**, the project will be transitioned to **collaborative maintenance**. Contributions from the wider Volumio community and external developers are welcome. The focus remains on stability, compatibility with Hardkernel kernel releases, and minimal maintenance overhead.
